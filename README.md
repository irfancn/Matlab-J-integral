# J_integral
J-Integral evaluation using line and area integral using the displacement field.


Run the Jintegral.m.


dic.mat file contains the displacement and the strain field. 


smoothn.m file is used to remove the noise (written by D Garcia https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25634-smoothn/).


Warning: There are spacial derivatives included in the formulation and the derivatives are sensitive to the noise in the displacement fields. So, one has to be careful and verify the results while using the code.
